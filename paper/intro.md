# Neuroscout

## Welcome
Within these pages we would like to provide a (interactive) walkthrough of our publication “” (please check the paper and the preprint). This walkthrough will outline the applied analyses steps and methods in more detail, including the used code and where possible results which can be rerun an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying Github repository and allow you to download the walkthrough
as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain analyses via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an hypothes.is plugin with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the Jupyter community, specifically, the Executable/Jupyter Book and mybinder project.

## Feedback & Questions
We would highly appreciate and value every feedback, idea or question you might have. Please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch with us. We would of course prefer if you would use the public comment function via the hypothes.is plugin (on the right side), but depending on your inquiry opening an issue in the GitHub repository would also be great.

## Thanks and Acknowledgment
We would like to thank the Jupyter community, specifically, the Executable/Jupyter Book and mybinder project for enabling us to create this walkthrough. Furthermore, we are grateful for the entire open neuroscience community and the amazing support and resources it provides. This includes the community driven development of data and processing standards, as well as unbelievable amount of software packages that made this project possible. We would additionally like thank ... . Our deepest gratitude also goes to the funding agencies that through their trust and financial support enabled this study. This includes …
